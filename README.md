# ⏳ Pomodoro Timer – Tkinter GUI with ttkbootstrap

A minimal and functional **Pomodoro timer** built using Python’s `tkinter` library, styled with `ttkbootstrap` for a modern interface.  
This application implements the popular **Pomodoro Technique** — alternating focused work sessions with timed breaks to improve productivity and reduce mental fatigue.

## 🎯 Objective

This project was initially created as part of my learning journey by following a tutorial by [Create a Pomodoro Timer App in Python! | Tutorial by Alina Chudnova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUWG5cm2Los).  
While the current version replicates the core functionality, I plan to **enhance and customize** it further with additional productivity features and UI improvements.
