# Pomodoro Timer – Tkinter GUI with ttkbootstrap

A minimal and functional **Pomodoro timer** built using Python’s `tkinter` library, styled with `ttkbootstrap` for a modern interface.  
This application implements the popular **Pomodoro Technique** — alternating focused work sessions with timed breaks to improve productivity and reduce mental fatigue.

## Objective

This project was initially created as part of my learning journey by following a tutorial by [Create a Pomodoro Timer App in Python! | Tutorial by Alina Chudnova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUWG5cm2Los).  
While the current version replicates the core functionality, I plan to **enhance and customize** it further with additional productivity features and UI improvements.

## Current Features

- **Modern UI** with a styled timer inside a red circular canvas.
- **Start**, **Stop**, and **Reset** buttons styled using `ttkbootstrap`.
- Displays the current countdown timer (work or break).
- Tracks **Pomodoros completed** and updates them in real-time.
- Smooth transitions between work sessions and short/long breaks.
- Neatly **centered** window (horizontally) and aligned **top** on screen.
- Uses the `cosmo` theme from `ttkbootstrap` for a clean, minimal feel.
